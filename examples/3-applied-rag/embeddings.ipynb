      "\n",
      "1. **Conduct a hazard assessment**: Identify potential slippery and wet areas on the job site, such as floors, stairs, and walkways.\n",
      "2. **Clean up spills immediately**: Ensure that any spills or leaks are cleaned up promptly to prevent slipping hazards.\n",
      "3. **Use warning signs**: Post warning signs in areas with slippery and wet surfaces to alert workers of the potential hazard.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Wear non-slip shoes**: Ensure that workers wear non-slip shoes or boots with good traction to prevent slipping on wet surfaces.\n",
      "2. **Use slip-resistant gloves**: Provide workers with slip-resistant gloves to prevent slipping on wet surfaces.\n",
      "3. **Use safety harnesses**: Ensure that workers are properly tied off to a safety line when working on wet surfaces, such as roofs or scaffolding.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Work Practices**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use proper ladder safety**: Ensure that ladders are properly positioned and secured on wet surfaces to prevent slipping.\n",
      "2. **Use scaffolding safely**: Ensure that scaffolding is properly erected and secured on wet surfaces to prevent slipping.\n",
      "3. **Use fall protection equipment**: Ensure that workers are properly equipped with fall protection gear, such as harnesses and lanyards, when working on wet surfaces.\n",
      "4. **Use non-slip coatings or mats**: Apply non-slip coatings or mats to wet surfaces to prevent slipping.\n",
      "5. **Slow down and use caution**: Encourage workers to slow down and use caution when working on wet surfaces to prevent accidents.\n",
